# Current Task: Testing the Deployment Process

## Objective

Test the deployment process for the Serra Frappe deployment to ensure it works correctly and document the process in detail.

## Test Plan

1. Set up a test environment
   - Create a test directory structure
   - Create a test configuration file based on env.example

2. Test the build.sh script
   - Build a custom Docker image with default parameters
   - Verify the image is created correctly

3. Test the deploy.sh script
   - Deploy the application using the custom image
   - Test different deployment options (with/without https, with/without proxy)

4. Verify services
   - Check that all containers are running
   - Verify that the application is accessible
   - Create a test site and install the serra-vine-configurator app

5. Test the update.sh script
   - Test updating the deployment
   - Verify that the update process works correctly

## Success Criteria

- All scripts (build.sh, deploy.sh, update.sh) execute without errors
- All services start correctly and are accessible
- A new site can be created and the serra-vine-configurator app can be installed
- The update process works correctly
- The deployment process is documented in detail

## Issues Encountered

- None yet

## Progress

1. ✅ Created a test directory structure
   - Created `work/test_deployment/config` directory
   - Created a symbolic link to the current repository at `work/test_deployment/serra-frappe-deployment`
   - Added the test directory to `.gitignore`

2. ✅ Created a test configuration file
   - Created `work/test_deployment/config/.env` based on `env.example`
   - Modified configuration for testing purposes:
     - Changed project name to avoid conflicts
     - Set a test database password
     - Changed HTTP port to 8090 to avoid conflicts

3. ✅ Created comprehensive testing documentation
   - Created `work/test_deployment/build_instructions.md` with instructions for testing the build.sh script
   - Created `work/test_deployment/deploy_instructions.md` with instructions for testing the deploy.sh script
   - Created `work/test_deployment/update_instructions.md` with instructions for testing the update.sh script
   - Created `work/test_deployment/test_plan.md` with a comprehensive test plan
   - Created `work/test_deployment/deployment_documentation.md` with detailed deployment documentation

## Objective Status

We have partially met our objective:

- ✅ Set up a test environment for testing the deployment process
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for the deployment process
- ❌ Actual execution of the test plan is still pending

The test environment and documentation are now ready, but we still need to execute the tests to fully meet our objective.

## Next Steps

1. Execute the test plan
   - Test the build.sh script
   - Test the deploy.sh script
   - Verify services
   - Test the update.sh script
   - Document any issues encountered

2. Update documentation based on test results
   - Add any issues encountered and their solutions
   - Refine the deployment documentation based on actual experience
