# Current Task: Testing the Deployment Process

## Objective

Test the deployment process for the Serra Frappe deployment to ensure it works correctly and document the process in detail.

## Updated Approach

Due to platform mismatch issues encountered during local testing, we're changing our approach:

1. **Previous Approach**: Build Docker images locally and use them for deployment testing
   - Issue: Platform mismatch between local build (ARM64) and deployment target (AMD64)
   - Challenge: Building for AMD64 on ARM-based Macs is slow due to emulation

2. **New Approach**: Use GitHub Actions to build and publish Docker images
   - Benefits:
     - Consistent build environment
     - Proper platform targeting (can build for AMD64 natively)
     - Mirrors production deployment workflow
     - Avoids local build issues
   - Process:
     - Set up GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish images
     - Pull these pre-built images for local deployment testing

## Test Plan

1. Set up a test environment
   - Create a test directory structure
   - Create a test configuration file based on env.example

2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   - Create a GitHub Actions workflow file for building Docker images
   - Configure the workflow to build for the appropriate platform (linux/amd64)
   - Set up image publishing to a container registry (GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub)
   - Test the workflow by triggering a build

3. Test the deploy.sh script with pre-built images
   - Pull the GitHub Actions-built image
   - Deploy the application using this image
   - Test different deployment options (with/without https, with/without proxy)

4. Verify services
   - Check that all containers are running
   - Verify that the application is accessible
   - Create a test site and install the serra-vine-configurator app

5. Test the update.sh script
   - Test updating the deployment
   - Verify that the update process works correctly

## Success Criteria

- GitHub Actions workflow successfully builds and publishes Docker images
- All scripts (deploy.sh, update.sh) execute without errors using the pre-built images
- All services start correctly and are accessible
- A new site can be created and the serra-vine-configurator app can be installed
- The update process works correctly
- The deployment process is documented in detail

## Issues Encountered

1. **Platform Mismatch Error**: When running the containers, we encountered a platform mismatch error:
   ```
   Error response from daemon: image with reference serra/frappe-test:v15 was found but its platform (linux/arm64) does not match the specified platform (linux/amd64)
   ```

   **Updated Solution**: Instead of modifying the build.sh script for platform support, we're now using GitHub Actions to build images for the correct target platform (linux/amd64). This eliminates the platform mismatch issue and provides a more production-like workflow.

2. **ARM-based Mac Compatibility Issue**: On ARM-based Macs, building for linux/amd64 might be slow or problematic due to emulation, but building for linux/arm64 can cause deployment issues.

   **Updated Solution**: By using GitHub Actions to build the images, we avoid the performance issues of cross-platform building on local machines. The GitHub Actions runners can build natively for the target platform.

## Progress

1. ✅ Created a test directory structure
   - Created `work/test_deployment/config` directory
   - Created a symbolic link to the current repository at `work/test_deployment/serra-frappe-deployment`
   - Added the test directory to `.gitignore`

2. ✅ Created a test configuration file
   - Created `work/test_deployment/config/.env` based on `env.example`
   - Modified configuration for testing purposes:
     - Changed project name to avoid conflicts
     - Set a test database password
     - Changed HTTP port to 8090 to avoid conflicts

3. ✅ Created comprehensive testing documentation
   - Created `work/test_deployment/build_instructions.md` with instructions for testing the build.sh script
   - Created `work/test_deployment/deploy_instructions.md` with instructions for testing the deploy.sh script
   - Created `work/test_deployment/update_instructions.md` with instructions for testing the update.sh script
   - Created `work/test_deployment/test_plan.md` with a comprehensive test plan
   - Created `work/test_deployment/deployment_documentation.md` with detailed deployment documentation

## Objective Status

We have partially met our objective:

- ✅ Set up a test environment for testing the deployment process
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for the deployment process
- ❌ Actual execution of the test plan is still pending
- ❌ GitHub Actions workflow setup is pending

The test environment and documentation are now ready, but we still need to set up the GitHub Actions workflow and execute the tests to fully meet our objective.

## Next Steps

1. Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Create a workflow file (.github/workflows/docker-build.yml)
   - Configure the workflow to build for linux/amd64
   - Set up image publishing to a container registry
   - Test the workflow by triggering a build

2. Update documentation to reflect the new approach
   - Update `work/test_deployment/build_instructions.md` to focus on GitHub Actions
   - Create `work/test_deployment/github_actions_setup.md` with instructions for setting up and using GitHub Actions
   - Update other documentation as needed

3. Execute the test plan
   - Pull the GitHub Actions-built image
   - Test the deploy.sh script with this image
   - Verify services
   - Test the update.sh script
   - Document any issues encountered

4. Update documentation based on test results
   - Add any issues encountered and their solutions
   - Refine the deployment documentation based on actual experience
